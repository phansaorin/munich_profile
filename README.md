masterbookingform
=================

We are creating a greate master booking, the purpose to organise the travel to Munic and Pamplona, with accomodation + activities and transportation

SOME REQUIREMENT
=====================================================================================================================

Tailormade model; here the clients create their own travel, so their own accomodation, their own dates and 
 
number of nights and their own activities on specific date.
 
Travelpackage; here the client can book a predefined accomodatation at predefined dates and number of nights and 
 
predefind activities at predefined dates and times.
 
 
● We have to create a master-bookingsform which must be able to use for all future travelwebsite.
 
Features of the bookingsform:
 
1) Be able to create and book an own tailormade travel on flexible dates and for a flexible number of 
 
nights.
 
There has to be a selecteble period in which tailormade travels can be booked, f.e.:
 
- Tailormade travels for the Munictravel can be made throughout the whole year except 15Sep-15Okt.
 
- Tailormade travels for the Pamplonatravel can be made only from 6-16Jul. 
 
2) Be able to book an accomodation with a numer of beds. (same accomodation during the travel)
 
3) Be able to book a bus, train, plane or ‘own travel’.
 
4) Be able to book activities during the travel on flexible dates and times.
 
5) Be able to book a predefined travelpackage on fixed dates for a fixed number of nights and a fixed 
 
number of activities on fixed dates and times.
 
● No use of Google Translate but a flagsystem, if you press on a countryflag the translated content of that 
 
specific page will be shown.
